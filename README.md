To use: 

-import correct packages 
-create env file with and add secrets 
-run agent file 
-prompt agent with 

"transfer {x} musd to {address}"
"send {x} btc to {address} 

Notes: 

-the parsing is currently very strict on tooling prompt calls 
-the agent will loop if your prompt is rejected 

Next Steps:

-make currently tools more robust ie expand user intent net 
-create plugins for mezo native dapps like musd, pampland, dumpyswap
-build os mezo agent kit package for langchain
